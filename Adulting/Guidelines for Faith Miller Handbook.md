# Introduction
 - I want to go to church activities more and soul-win more as well. I will gear my time towards the things of God's work. Meaning, I will not skip out on church, church activities or soul-winning for the sake of my personal goals, projects and what I am studying or working towards. 
 - I want to spend 2-3 hours a day learning a language, assuming I have the capacity. I will use programs such as Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, Pimsluer or any other learning program I deem as profitable.
 - I will practice at least 30 minutes of piano, 40 minutes on health and at least 1 hour learning code.
 - I will work on becoming a fit, suitable and loving future house wife. I will spend 20 minutes in the morning and evening lightly working out so as to maintain a healthy body. I will play Pickleball with my family when possible.
 - I will practice Arithmetic and English puzzles everyday for less then 10 minutes each so as to remember basic math logic and grammar.
 - I will read when I can, alternating what subjects I choose to study so as to accommodate the seasons of life I am in.
 - I will clean the house when needed. I want to focus on deep cleaning the house as in cleaning toilets, tubs, whip down surfaces, etc. I want to organize the home for easier access to items as much as I am permitted and when time is available.

 I feel it is imprtant to learn about health for my own well being and for the sake of my family's well being. If I ever become a mother I will need to know how to treat my husbend and children when they are unwell. Eventually I may need to know how to care for my parents or parent(s) in law when they are elderly.

# Housework

 I will need to know how to cook for a household someday. I want to be able to independently cook meals that are both healthy and enjoyable. 
 You can start by cooking meals for family you have now.
## Shop

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 31:14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+31:14?translation=kjv)

 When I am married, it will most likely be my job to do the grocrey shopping. I will need to familierize myself with what meat to perchuse, where to buy good quality and cheap clothes, and how to seek out the best deals so money is not wasted. 
 When you are shopping it is a good idea to find the best deals and remember which store has the best price for perticular items. You can also try to bargan. You will not get a good deal if you do not ask for it.
## Clean
 It is hopfully going to be my job to run a house. I will need to know how to be a good housekeeper if I am going to get married someday.
### Bedroom
 Your room is to be cleaned and straghtened before you leave for church or other activities each morning. Beds must be made; clothes must be put away; trash cans should be dumped; and your room must be neat. Floors must be free of obviose trash, dirt, or clutter. Trash bags can not be left outside your door.
### Bathrooms
 The bathroom is to be cleaned at least once a week. Mirrors are to be wiped; tubs are to be scrubbed and rinsed; toliets are to be wipped down; sinks are to be wipped down; trash cans are to be dumped; and floors are to be swept. If you see any bugs, be sure to get them killed or thrown out.

### Dishes
 It is good for the dishes to be done everyday before bed at a resonable time. Put away clean and dry dishes before washing the dirty ones. Dishwasher safe items are to be put in the dishwasher, then run it; other items are to be washed in soupy water, then rinsed in worm water; dry them by hand with a cloth or put in them in the drying rack.
### Organize
 It is nice to have a clean room, but it would be better to have your things organized as well. You may organize by topic, color, hight, materal, ect.

are clothed with scarlet.

is
 silk and purple.

 You are to make a habit of doing loads of laundry once a week. It will be benifital to know how when you have a household of children and a husbend who will need clean clothes. 
### Other
 Be sure to vaccume, dust, and tidy the house once per week to avoid any build ups of uncleaniness. Even when it looks clean, persisting to build the habit of vaccumeing, dusting and esspsialy tidding, will help you in the long run and wash things away you may not be able to see that are building up dirt.

# Apperence
 Athogh apperence is not as imported as charector and inteligents it still affects they way we feel about ourself and how others initially presive us. It is good to have a healthy whiet, good posture and dress right for the occation. It is also good to dress femine and modestly. There's nothing wrong with having good gruming habets so we look our best. Make-up is not bad, however, I do not think it is nessesry to be pretty. A friendly smile always helps.
## Gruming
### Eyebrows
 Pluck. No unibrow please.
 Brush. Do not go crazy, though.
### Nails
 Clip
 File
### Skin
 Wash with soup and water. Try to take colder showers. You can gradually make it a little cooler each shower until you have become comfertable with cold shwers.

## Clothes

are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.

> [!Bible] [Proverbs 31:30 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Proverbs+31:30?translation=kjv)
> 30. Favour
is deceitful, and beauty
is vain:
but
 a woman
that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

 The goal is not to attract unwanted attention by they way you dress. It is to look pretty, modest, and approprite for the ativities in which you are dressing for. Do not waer bright neon tie-die clothse becase that will make you look juvenile and attract a lot of attention on yourself without nessesarly looking pretty. Use commen sence when choosing colors, patterns and so on.
### Skirts and Dresses
 Skirts and dresses must have the frount anf back heamline reach the flour when I am in an upright, kneling postion with my knees touching the flour. They must cover at least half the knee if paired with leggings. Otherwize it is best for the heamline to reach below the knee so as to cover my thigh whale seated. If there are slits be sure they are no higher then these standers.
### Shirts
 The neakline of the shirt should not be lower then three fingers from the colorbone. It may not be too tightly fitted so as to attract unwanted attention. When in formal or church settings the shirst should not be a T-shirst or too baggy. It may not expose your misriff. You should be able to reach above your head, down to the floor, and to the side without showing any midriff. Be sure if it is see throgh you waer an undershirt. Avoid sheer materials. Be sure to use commen sence and good judgment.
### Shoes
 NEVER WEAR HEELS. If you must comply in wearing heels be sure you do not wear them for more then 3 hours and the heels is no more then 3 inches tall. Otherwize just avoid heels alltogether because they can cause knee and lower back pain later in life. 
 For formal or church setting it woud be best to waer dress shoes when posiable. If you are going soul-winning afterwards, however, be sure you do not waer anything that is uncomfertable to walk in or waer for an exsteded perid of time.

## Hair
 Be sure to maintain healthy hair by washing it once or twice a week. Do not wash it too often because that can cause it to perduse more oils then you want. Brush it whenever it needs ti brushed. Keep the hair langth at a minimum below your sholders. Any higher then that may apper unatractive. Do not waer your hair in juvenile hairstyiles. Act your age with how you look.
### No pigtails
 Braids are fine.

# Dating Guidelines

## Alone with men
 Do not ever be in a secluded area alone with a man. If you find that you are alone, walk away.
 Do not be in a car alone with a man. No exceptions. Even if you both have only good intentions it can still be the appernce of evil. You as a women, should not be that trusting of men to be alone in a car with them. Do not think that you can escape if they are not the person you thought they were. They will always be stronger then you. Be sure there is at least one other woman in the car. If you are the only female, be sure one of them men is a family member to you.
## If you get asked out
 If you do not know if you like him, say, "You seem very nice, but, If you don't mind, I'll have to check with my brother or Dad on that."
 If you do not like him, say, "?"
 If you like him, say, "Okay, that should be fine, I need to dubble check but I am sure it would be okay." Then smile at him like he is a friend.
## Standers
### Must have permition from Dad to be in a relationship
### Chaperone
 Always have a chaperone on the date. Or at least sitting at a nearby table.
### No touching
 Handshacks are fine. Just do not touch him in any way you would not touch your brother. 
### No hugs
 If you can not avoid the hug, quickly turn it into a side hug. Otherwize back away or just tell them you only hug your husbend.
### No holding hands
### No kissing

### NO FORNICATION
## Trinity Baptist Bible Collage Philosophy (shortened)
 (1) During the age of 18-19, develop friendships, both female and male.
 (2) During these years (18-19), allow the Lord and good counsel to help you develop a list of characteristicts that you should look for in a man. 
 (3) During the age of 20-21, God will often direct you to your future husbend. 
 (4) The word of God speakes of a multitude of counsellors three times in Proverbs. Your counsellors should be your parents, your pastor, and other Godly men and women that the Lord has put in your life.
